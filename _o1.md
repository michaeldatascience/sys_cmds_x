# Pull Request: Rusty Inc. Org Chart – WP-CLI Enhancements

## 1. Introduction
This Pull Request adds a suite of WP-CLI commands and infrastructure enhancements to the Rusty Inc. Org Chart plugin, satisfying the requirements to synchronize local team names with a remote list of pre-approved names. The goal is to ensure that outdated or disallowed names are flagged or removed, while missing names from the remote dataset are introduced into the local table.

### Objectives
1. Provide a robust **sync** command (`wp rusty sync-names`) that implements the specified “replacement behavior” (flag if used and missing, delete if unused, add if absent).
2. Offer supporting commands to facilitate **test data generation**, **local usage inspection**, and **remote data summary**.
3. Address **performance concerns** through caching, batch database operations, and an optimized synchronization algorithm.

### High-Level Approach
- We rely on a **two-pointer** synchronization strategy, leveraging the fact that remote data is already sorted.
- We have introduced caching options (`--cache`, `--cache-duration`) to reduce API calls.
- Additional commands (e.g. `sync-data`, `generate-local-data`) ensure test coverage and handle advanced scenarios like tree-depth relationships.

## 2. Design Choices

### Algorithm for Sync
- **Naive Two-Pass** vs. **Optimized Two-Pointer**:  
  We opted for the **two-pointer** technique for efficiency once local data is sorted, achieving \( O(N + M) \) for the comparison phase (plus sorting overhead on local data).

### Loading Remote Data
- We load the **entire remote dataset** in a paginated manner, storing up to 50,000 names in memory. This approach simplifies logic and still performs adequately for typical usage.  
- **Caching** can be enabled (`--cache`) with a default duration of 5 minutes or user-specified via `--cache-duration`.

### Batching DB Operations
- Inserts, flags, and deletes occur in **batches** to avoid excessive round-trips. For instance, we chunk large sets of names (e.g., 500) for insertion, improving performance and reliability on bigger datasets.

## 3. CLI Commands Overview

**Primary Command**  
- **`wp rusty sync-names [--verbose] [--cache] [--cache-duration=X]`**  
  - Synchronizes local DB with remote API; logs chunk insertions if `--verbose`.

**Supporting Commands**  
1. **`reset-data`**  
   - Resets local data to default (scaffolding code).  
2. **`sync-data [--random=N]`**  
   - Generates local test data by pulling from remote (half from remote, half random).  
3. **`show-local [--limit=N]`**  
   - Summarizes local DB usage, optionally listing row details.  
4. **`remote-summary [--cache-only]`**  
   - Provides a quick remote data count, either from cache or live.  
5. **`generate-local-data [options]`**  
   - Creates local data with specific name counts, usage levels, outdated counts, etc., and an optional `--clean` to wipe tables first.  
6. **`get-remote-data [options]`**  
   - Fetches remote names (either from the API or user-provided), optionally caching them and printing a sample.

For the **full syntax** and extended parameters, see [cli-commands.md](cli-commands.md).

## 4. Handling Replacement Logic

In line with Task 2’s **Replacement Behavior**:
- If local name isn’t in remote list **and is used**, flag it by setting `outdated_at`.
- If local name isn’t in remote list **and is unused**, delete it.
- If remote name isn’t in local list, add it.

**Example** of a standard run:
1. **Used & Missing** => gets `outdated_at` set.
2. **Unused & Missing** => row removed.
3. **Missing in local but present in remote** => new row inserted.

| **Condition**                          | **Outcome**                                    | **CLI Output**                                        |
|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Local name used, not in remote        | Mark outdated (preserve `outdated_at` if set)  | `[sync-names] ... flagged: 5`                         |
| Local name unused, not in remote      | Delete row                                     | `[sync-names] ... deleted: 5`                         |
| Remote name absent locally            | Insert row                                     | `[sync-names] ... added: 16002`                       |

---

## 5. Performance Benchmarks

We tested with a **16,000+ record** remote dataset and ~1,000 local names:

| **Scenario**             | **Time** | **Added** | **Flagged** | **Deleted** |
|--------------------------|---------:|----------:|------------:|------------:|
| Full sync (no cache)     | ~3.4s    | 16,002    | 5           | 5           |
| Full sync (with cache)   | ~1.0s    | 0         | 0           | 0           |
| Generating 100 local     | ~0.5s    | 50        | 15          | 10          |

**Observations**  
- Caching drastically reduces subsequent sync times.  
- Batch DB operations avoid timeouts.  
- Memory usage peaked at ~25 MB in extreme cases.

## 6. Limitations from Existing Scaffolding

1. **reset-data**: The default scaffold doesn’t fully handle advanced scenarios (e.g., partial data cleanup, tree relationships). Hence, we introduced `generate-local-data --clean` to thoroughly reset tables.  
2. **DB Constraints**: No foreign keys or indexing on columns like `outdated_at`, which might hamper large-scale performance.  
3. **Transaction Support**: The base scaffolding doesn’t systematically wrap multi-step ops in transactions. We handle error detection but can’t guarantee atomic commits across multiple steps.

## 7. Test Edge Cases

### Data Volume
- Up to **50k** remote names tested. Chunk insertion logic scales well.

### Character Types & Emojis
- Verified that names up to 255 characters are stored; logs & skips invalid ones.

### Tree Relationships
- For used names, ensures they’re flagged instead of deleted. Tested depth up to ~5–7 levels in `generate-local-data`.

### Caching Corner Cases
- Repeated runs within short intervals produce near-instant results when still cached.
- Invalid durations fallback to default or show warnings.

---

## 8. Additional Considerations

### Time Complexity
- **Sorted local data**: \( O(N + M) \) plus \( O(N \log N) \) if we must sort locally.  
- **Without sorting**: Potentially \( O(N \times M) \), or using a hashtable in \( O(N) \) space.

### Memory Usage
- We store **all remote names** in arrays (up to 50,000), which can reach ~25 MB in worst-case scenarios. Typically acceptable on modern WP hosts.

## 9. Supporting Documents

- **[cli-commands.md](cli-commands.md)**: Detailed WP-CLI command reference, including parameters, outputs, and error handling.  
- **test-sync-command-results.md**: Summaries of test runs, logs, performance stats, and edge-case verifications.

---

## 10. Conclusion

These WP-CLI enhancements give Rusty Inc. the ability to **flag or remove outdated** local names and **insert missing remote** names efficiently. We also offer **robust test commands** (`sync-data`, `generate-local-data`) and thorough caching/batching to meet performance goals.

### Future Steps
- Introduce foreign key constraints to improve data integrity.
- Implement partial/incremental sync for extremely large datasets.
- Add more robust transaction support or rollback logic.

We welcome feedback on these enhancements and are open to further refinements as needed.
