# Pull Request: Rusty Inc. Org Chart â€“ WP-CLI Enhancements

## 1. Introduction

This pull request introduces a robust WP-CLI tool for synchronizing team names between a remote API and a local database, adhering to the requirements set by Rusty Inc. The tool ensures that local team names are updated to reflect a centralized, pre-approved list of names, while handling edge cases such as outdated names, deletions, and additions efficiently.

### Objectives:
- Implement a reliable synchronization mechanism between local and remote name lists.
- Provide comprehensive error handling and edge case management.
- Ensure performance optimization for large datasets.
- Offer extensive testing capabilities to validate the synchronization logic.

### High-Level Approach:
The solution employs a two-pointer synchronization algorithm for optimal performance, configurable caching to reduce network overhead, and batched database operations to maintain efficiency. The design choices were guided by performance benchmarks and real-world testing scenarios.

## 2. Design Choices

### Algorithm for Sync
Two approaches were considered:
1. **Naive Two-Pass Algorithm**: O(N*M) time complexity, where N is the local dataset size and M is the remote dataset size.
2. **Two-Pointer Algorithm (Chosen)**: O(N log N + M) time complexity, leveraging the sorted nature of the remote data.

**Decision**: The two-pointer algorithm was chosen for its superior performance, minimal memory overhead, and cleaner code structure.

### Loading Remote Data
Two strategies were evaluated:
1. **Full Dataset Loading**: Loads the entire remote dataset at once, simplifying synchronization logic.
2. **Batched Loading**: Fetches data incrementally, reducing memory usage but increasing code complexity.

**Decision**: Full dataset loading was implemented due to manageable dataset sizes (~16K names) and efficient API pagination.

### Batching DB Operations
Database operations (inserts, updates, deletes) are performed in configurable batches to optimize performance and reduce memory usage. Batch sizes were determined through performance testing.

## 3. CLI Commands Overview

### Key Command: `wp rusty sync-names`
```bash
wp rusty sync-names [--verbose] [--cache] [--cache-duration=<minutes>]
