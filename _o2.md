# Pull Request: Rusty Inc. Org Chart – WP-CLI Enhancements

## 1. Introduction
This Pull Request enriches the Rusty Inc. Org Chart plugin with a powerful suite of **WP-CLI** commands, fulfilling the requirement to synchronize local team names against a remote list of pre-approved names. The solution ensures that **outdated or invalid names** are flagged or removed, while **missing** remote-approved names are properly inserted.

### Objectives
- Provide a **reliable, configurable `sync-names`** command that implements the required “replacement behavior” for each scenario (flag if used, delete if unused, add if remote-only).
- Offer **auxiliary CLI commands** to generate test data, inspect local DB usage, and check remote data or caching status.
- Address **performance** by leveraging **caching**, **batch database operations**, and an **optimized two-pointer** synchronization algorithm.

### High-Level Approach
- **Two-Pointer** logic for streamlined name comparison: remote data is sorted, local data can be sorted once to achieve near O(N+M) complexity.
- **Caching** for repeated runs (`--cache`, `--cache-duration`) to avoid repetitive network calls.
- **Batch inserts/updates** to minimize overhead on large data sets.

## 2. Design Choices

### Algorithm for Sync
1. **Naive Two-Pass** (O(N×M)): scanning each local name against the entire remote list.
2. **Two-Pointer Method** (Chosen): Sorting local data (O(N log N)), then merging it with remote data (O(N+M)).

**Decision**: The two-pointer technique is significantly more scalable for large sets (e.g., 16K–50K names). It also helps keep memory usage in check by sequentially traversing both lists only once after sorting.

### Loading Remote Data
- **Full Dataset**: We load all remote names with pagination, storing up to 50,000 entries in memory. This approach simplifies the comparison logic and maintains clarity.
- **Caching**: If `--cache` is provided, we either retrieve or set a transient (default 5 minutes) to avoid unnecessary API hits.

### Batching DB Operations
- **Insert** chunks (default 500) to handle large sets without timeouts.
- **Flag Outdated** in a single or minimal-batch update, improving performance over row-by-row queries.
- **Delete** in batch to clean out large groups of unused names in one pass.

## 3. CLI Commands Overview

**Primary**  
- **`wp rusty sync-names [--verbose] [--cache] [--cache-duration=N]`**  
  Synchronizes local DB with remote data, respecting the replacement rules. Logs chunk details if `--verbose`.

**Supporting**  
1. `reset-data` – Resets local data to defaults (scaffolding).  
2. `sync-data --random=N` – Creates random local data for test coverage (pulling half from remote).  
3. `show-local [--limit=N]` – Summarizes local names: total, outdated, used, etc.  
4. `remote-summary [--cache-only]` – Shows a quick count of remote data from cache or live.  
5. `generate-local-data [--names=50 --used=10 --outdated=5 --tree-depth=3 --clean]` – Creates local data with optional wipe.  
6. `get-remote-data [--remote-names=...]` – Either fetches from the real API or uses user-provided names, helpful for debugging remote usage.

## 4. Handling Replacement Logic

We adhere to the **Task 2** guidelines:

| **Condition**                                     | **Action**                               | **Result**                                            |
|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Local name missing in remote & used by a team     | Flag as outdated (set `outdated_at`)     | `outdated_at = NOW()` if not already set              |
| Local name missing in remote & **not** used       | Delete                                   | Removed from DB                                       |
| Remote name not present locally                   | Insert                                   | New row in `wp_rusty_inc_names`                       |

**Example**  
If `Treat Specialist` is used but not in the remote list, it becomes flagged with `outdated_at = <timestamp>`. If `Snacks` is unused and not in remote, it is removed. Meanwhile, newly introduced remote name `NewInvention` is inserted.

## 5. Performance Benchmarks

We tested a scenario with **16,000+** remote entries & local data of varying sizes:

| **Scenario**       | **Time**  | **Added** | **Flagged** | **Deleted** | **Peak Mem** |
|--------------------|----------:|----------:|------------:|------------:|-------------:|
| Full sync (uncached)  | ~3.4s    | 16,002    | 5           | 5           | ~20MB        |
| Full sync (cached)    | ~1.0s    | 0         | 0           | 0           | ~15MB        |
| Test data (100 names) | ~0.5s    | 50        | 15          | 10          | ~8MB         |

Observations:
- **Caching** yields a major speed-up in subsequent syncs (time cut by ~70%).
- **Chunk** insertion prevents slowdowns or timeouts.
- **Memory** usage up to ~20–25 MB on the largest merges, which is typically acceptable in WP environments.

## 6. Limitations from Existing Scaffolding

1. **reset-data**: The default code doesn’t fully handle advanced partial table resets or tree complexities, prompting additional commands like `generate-local-data` or `sync-data` with more control.  
2. **DB Constraints**: No indexing or foreign keys. Large-scale performance or data integrity might benefit from adding them.  
3. **Transactions**: We do partial fallback, but the base code doesn’t provide full transaction support across all operations.

## 7. Test Edge Cases

- **Data Volume**: Up to 50k remote names tested. Chunk logic scales well.
- **Name Character**: Verified special chars, 255-length strings, and emojis get stored (invalid ones are logged and skipped).
- **Tree Depth**: Some local data sets up to depth 5–7 (e.g., `generate-local-data --tree-depth=5`) confirmed correct usage flags vs. deletes.
- **Cache Corner Cases**: Consecutive runs within short intervals produce near-instant results if caching is valid.

For further details, see **test-sync-command-results.md**.

## 8. Additional Considerations

### Time Complexity
- With local data pre-sorted: **O(N + M)** for the two-pointer pass (plus sorting overhead **O(N log N)** if needed).
- Potential overhead if local is large and unsorted, but we mitigate it via an initial single sort.

### Memory Usage
- We store all remote names in arrays. On the upper bound (50k names), memory usage can reach ~25 MB. Usually manageable, but worth noting for smaller hosting solutions.

## 10. Conclusion
This PR provides a **robust, flexible** WP-CLI suite meeting Rusty Inc.’s requirements for name synchronization:
- **flag** used names that no longer appear in the remote list,
- **delete** unused local names missing in remote,
- **insert** newly introduced remote names.

### Future Steps
- Introduce **indexing or FK constraints** for better DB performance/integrity.
- Evaluate **transactions** for multi-step atomic changes.
- Possibly consider **incremental** or **async** sync if dataset grows further.

**We welcome feedback** on these enhancements and are available for any iterative improvements needed.
